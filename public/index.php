						Just For Us – A Community of I&amp;O Wellness Center, Inc. · Build Connection · Thrive · Have Fun
					</p>
					<p>
						As the Just For Us Team, our community was created because we kept seeing the same gap:
						neurodiverse adults often age out of youth services without the structure, connection, or safe
						social environment they still deeply need. Families want guidance. Young adults want belonging.
						And too often, they are left navigating the world alone.
					</p>
					<p>
						One moment made this need unmistakably clear. A neurodiverse young adult we supported
						unintentionally connected with unsafe individuals online while simply searching for companionship.
						Her innocence — and her vulnerability — reminded us that without consistent, healthy community,
						people are far more at risk. Connection is not just meaningful. It is protective.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our founder, Julie Maria, brings a rich blend of professional and lived experiences that shape
						this vision. As a registered New Jersey DDD vendor and positive behavior support coach, her work is
						grounded in healthcare administration, human resources, and behavioral sciences. Her volunteer work
						in her church’s children’s ministry — especially supporting children who need additional patience and
						understanding — continues to deepen her compassion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Her journey as a cancer survivor taught her what it means to overcome challenges, defy expectations,
						and believe in the possibility of better days. That resilience is carried into everything we do.
